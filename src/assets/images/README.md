Images folder for the React Native app.

Guidelines:
- Put static images here and reference them from JS with require('../assets/images/your.png')
- For multiple densities, name files as: image.png, image@2x.png, image@3x.png
- Try to keep file sizes small and provide correct aspect ratio sizes.

Example:
- src/assets/images/logo.png
- src/assets/images/logo@2x.png
- src/assets/images/logo@3x.png
